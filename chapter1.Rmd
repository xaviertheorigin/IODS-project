##The first comment
I'm feeling **excited** to start this new course. I am expecting to learn how to use R and apply it for my studies in social psychology. I think with the current amount of data that is collected everyday, social sciences as a whole has great chances of improving.
I first knew about this course after contacting Kimmo, as recommended by the coordinator of my master's programme.
